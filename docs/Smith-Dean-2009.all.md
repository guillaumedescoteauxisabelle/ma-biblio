 [...] there are many rich and innovative ways in which creative practice can constitute, or contribute to, research in the university environment.

Creative work within the university environment is now often referred to as practice-led research, practice-based research, creative research or practice as research.



practice can result in research insight

Les recherches académiques peuvent mener à la pratique créative.  
La théorie nourrit la pratique et la pratique nourrit la théorie dans un processus itératif cyclique.
