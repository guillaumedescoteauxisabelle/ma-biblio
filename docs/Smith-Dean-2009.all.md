 [...] there are many rich and innovative ways in which creative practice can constitute, or contribute to, research in the university environment.



bi-directional focus
--------------------



ponder how academic research can impact positively on creative practice



Creative work within the university environment is now often referred to as practice-led research, practice-based research, creative research or practice as research.



practice can result in research insight
---------------------------------------



Les recherches académiques peuvent mener à la pratique créative.  
La théorie nourrit la pratique et la pratique nourrit la théorie dans un processus itératif cyclique.

> [...] academic research can lead to creative practice. We do not see practice-led research and research-led practice as separate processes, but as interwoven in an iterative cyclic web, a model we develop later in the chapter.

However, in the last two to three decades, the idea that arts practice might be a form of research has been developing ascendency. Terms such as practice-led research have been developed by creative practitioners, partly for political purposes within higher education, research and other environments, to explain, justify and promote their activities, and to argue – as forcefully as possible in an often unreceptive environment – that they are as important to the generation of knowledge as more theoretically, critically or empirically based research methods.
