 [...] current generative RNN techniques do not allow real-time interactive control of the sequence generation process, thus aren’t well suited for live creative expression .

  



ll does not provide real-time continuous control in the manner required for the creation of expressive interface

Yet another problematic area concerns aesthetic evaluation. Are entirely novel aesthetic considerations relevant for CG-art in general, or for some subclass of it? And are some aesthetic criteria, normally regarded as essential, utterly out of place in CG-art: authenticity, for instance?


We’ll see that judgements concerning creativity, authorial responsibility, agency, autonomy, authenticity and (sometimes) ontology are even more problematic outside the precious bubble than inside it.

Les opportunités d'augmentation ne se produisent pas à la surface mais avec des considérations fondamentales sur la structure qui permettent une compréhension des implications concrètes de ce qui structure une décision.  Dans cette structure sous-jascente à la surface se trouvent les possibilités d'augmentation.

>The problem is to understand the concrete implications (through to the surface) of the structural decisions. This is where a significant opportunity for augmentation arises.

We propose an additional classifier that estimates the minimal amount of regularization required to enforce disentanglement. Thus both representations to- gether can completely explain an image while being independent of each other. Previous methods based on adversarial approaches fail to enforce this independence, while methods based on variational approaches lead to uninformative representations.

>As innovation emphasizes the implementation of ideas, creativity is typically regarded as the first stage of innovation in which generating ideas becomes the dominant focus (Tang and Werner, 2017; Amabile, 1996; Mumford and Gustafson, 1988; Rank et al., 2004; West, 2002). In other words, if creativity is absent, innovation could be just luck. [...]  definition of creativity remains rather controversial,  mainly due to its complex nature (Tang and Werner, 2017; Hernández-Romero, 2017).
