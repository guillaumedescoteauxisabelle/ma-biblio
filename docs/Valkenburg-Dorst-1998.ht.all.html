<p> [...] four activities (naming, framing, moving and reflecting) and their relations:  the ‘mechanism of reflective practice’.  The designers  start by naming the relevant issues in the design situation, framing [...] making moves towards a solution, and reflecting on those moves and the current frame.  (p.254)</p>

<hr>
<p>Schon’s theory is based on a <strong>constructionist</strong> view of human perception and thought processes: through the execution of &#39;move-testing experiments&#39; (involving action and reflection), a designer is actively constructing a view of the world based on his/her experiences.</p>

<hr>
<p>Donald Schon’s theory is often called ‘reflective practice’, it is concerned with more than just reflection. Four different kinds of design actions exist, and we are interested in the <strong>occurrence of all</strong> [...]   in the flow of how they are used by the designers.</p>

<p>This method was tested by applying it in the description of the activities of two design teams. The description method proves to be very useful, in that it allows a concise description of a design project in which the elements vital to the understanding of the design progress are conserved</p>

<p> [...] little of the research methods currently used in design methodology is suited for our purposes. <strong>The complexity of design has always made it difficult to study real life design activity</strong>, and none of the existing research methods to observe and describe designing provides us with data that is rich enough, in that it spans both the design process and relevant aspects of the design context.</p>

<p>These lie in <strong>synchronising the thoughts and activities</strong> of the team members.</p>

<p>This addition to the structure of our description method shows the overview of the subjects the teams attend to and gives some added insight in the teams’ strategies for approaching the design task.</p>

<p>This way of describing team activities provides a good framework for dis- cussion on team designing. In education it can be very useful to either illustrate design professionals-in-action or to confront design teams with their own practice.</p>
