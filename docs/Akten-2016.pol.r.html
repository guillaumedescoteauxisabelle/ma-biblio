<p>an autonomous agent sketches images while optionally allowing a user to directly influence the agent’s trajectory.</p>
<p>computational models of creativity</p>
<p>#context<br>[[AIContext]] </p>
<p> [...] we focus on investigating the opportunities provided by Deep artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) — in particular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) — combined with agent-based AI methods — such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) — for the task of driving collaborative drawing agents</p>
<p>#goal<br>[[AIInvestigation]] </p>
<p>We combine Monte Carlo Tree Search with image classifiers and test both shallow models (e.g. multinomial logistic regression) and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (e.g. LeNet, Inception v3).</p>
<p>The aim of this research is to create an autonomous, collaborative, ‘creative’ agent that can sketch images in realtime, while optionally allowing a user to intervene and physically influence the agent, affecting how and what it decides to draw.  [...] our objective is to allow the agent to take random actions, and sketch any path that resembles a predetermined, desired object class .</p>
