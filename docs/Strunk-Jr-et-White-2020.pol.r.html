<p>&#39;The Elements of Style&#39; (1918), by William Strunk, Jr., is an American English writing style guide. It is the best-known, most influential prescriptive treatment of English grammar and usage, and often is required reading and usage in U.S. high school and university composition classes. This edition of &#39;The Elements of Style&#39; details eight elementary rules of usage, ten elementary principles of composition, &quot;a few matters of form&quot;, and a list of commonly misused words and expressions.</p>
