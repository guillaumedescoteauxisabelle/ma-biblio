 [...] current generative RNN techniques do not allow real-time interactive control of the sequence generation process, thus arenâ€™t well suited for live creative expression .

  



----

 [...] most current applications of sequence generation with RNNs is not a real-time, interactive process.

  



----

ll does not provide real-time continuous control in the manner required for the creation of expressive interface
