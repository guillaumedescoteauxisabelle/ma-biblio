METAPHOR AND REPRESENTATION



Generative metaphor: A perspective on problem-setting in social policy DONALD A . SCHON



>Metaphor, in this tradition, is a kind of anomaly of language, one which must be dispelled in order to clear the path for a general theory of reference or meaning.



> [...] "metaphor" refers both to a certain kind of product - a perspective or frame, a way of looking at things - and to a certain kind of process - a process by which new perspectives on the world come into existence. (p.137)
