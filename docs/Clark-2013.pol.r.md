## Abstract

Brains, it has recently been argued, are essentially prediction machines. They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. The paper critically examines this ‘hierarchical prediction machine’ approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a unified science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual. The paper ends (sections 4 and 5) by asking how such approaches might impact our more general vision of mind, experience, and agency.

Action - oriented predictive processing (Traitement prédictif orienté action)



>Perceptual learning and inference is necessary to induce prior expectations about how the sensorium unfolds. Action is engaged to resample the world to fulfil these expectations. This places perception and action in intimate relation and accounts for both with the same principle (Friston, Daunizeau, and Kiebel (2009) p. 12)

  

La perception de la sensation nécessite un apriori d'inférence permettant un apprentissage nécessaire à l'amélioration de l'atteinte des intentions par l'action.



3.4 Situated Agents
-------------------



> [...] the hierarchical predictive processing perspective suggests concerning situated [...] agency (Thelen and Smith (1994), Hutchins (1995), Wilson (1994) (2004), Haugeland (1998), Hurley (1998), Clark (1997) (2008), Clark and Chalmers (1998), Rowlands (1 999) (2006), Noë (2004), (2009), Wheeler (2005), Menary (2007)). At least on the face of it, the predictive processing story seem to pursue a rather narrowly neurocentric focus, albeit one that reveals (1.5 above) some truly intimate links between perception and action.
