style transfer has received a lot of attent



 [...] much of this research has aimed at speeding up processing, the approaches are still lacking from a principled, art historical standpoint: a style is more than just a single image or an artist, but previous work is limited to only a single instance of a style or shows no benefit from more image.  (Sanakoyeu et al., 2018)



 [...] pre-trained on ImageNet, [...] can introduce an extra bias, since it has been assembled without artistic consideration.  (Sanakoyeu et al., 2018)



To circumvent these issues, we propose a **style-aware content loss**, which is trained jointly with a deep encoder-decoder network for real-time, high-resolution stylization of images and video

Extra Qualitative Results
-------------------------

Altering the style of an existing artwork Our method is able to change the style of an existing artwork, rendering it in another style. It means, that our algorithm can also handle content images which are artistic, which, to our knowledge, was never shown in previous work before. We refer the reader to the results on the project page.
