age contents across generalized data sets [Simonyan and
Zisserman 2015]

(2) Layers of pre-trained deep CNNs can be activated to match
content  and  style  statistics,  and  thus  perform  a
neural
style transfer
(NST) between
arbitrary
images [Gatys et al.
2016b] (Figure 1)

Style Transfer using Image Analogies : Techniques that
use image pairs for training‚Äîa source image and an artistic
depiction of this image‚Äîi. e., to learn an analogous transfor-
mation such that content images can be transformed into
an artistic rendering of similar visual style [Hertzmann
et al. 2001].

Style Transfer using Neural Networks: Techniques that
employ neural networks to separate and recombine the
content and style of arbitrary inputs. Typically, loss func-
tions are minimized iteratively to balance the components
of
style
and
content
in the output [Gatys et al. 2016b], or
train feed-forward neural networks for linear image trans-
formation [Johnson et al. 2016a,b].

(1) Heuristics-based Algorithms: Paradigms that are based
on rendering functions, which are implemented by a do-
main expert who explicitly models individual artistic styles
and its correspondent design aspects or mechanisms. This
group basically comprises stroke-based rendering, region-
based techniques, image processing and ltering, and may
also account for physically-based simulations.

(2) Style Transfer Algorithms : Example-based rendering
which is directed to learn or reproduce artistic styles from
visual examples (ground-truth data sets). This type often
comprises statistical models and optimization schemes to
balance aspects of
content
and
style
in the stylized output
