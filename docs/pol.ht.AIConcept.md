>It would be highly desirable if we could instead specify only a high-level goal, like “make the output indistinguishable from reality”, and then automatically learn a loss function appropriate for satisfying this goal. Fortunately, this is exactly what is done by the recently proposed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [ 22 , 12 , 41 , 49 , 59 ]   (Isola et al., 2017, p.1126)

Deep learning, which has its roots from conventional neural networks, significantly outperforms its predecessors. It utilizes graph technologies with transformations among neurons to develop many-layered learning models.
