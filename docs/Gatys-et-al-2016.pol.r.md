Rendering the semantic content of an image in different styles is a difficult image processing task.



ack of image representations that explicitly represent semantic in- formation



use image representations derived from Convolutional Neural Networks optimised for object recognition



A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style that can separate and recombine the image content and style of natural images.
