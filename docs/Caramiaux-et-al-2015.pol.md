Another important feature of the algorithm resides in causal inference. This repre- sents a clear advantage for interactive applications, since partial results are available during the gestures (and not only after gesture completion). This allows the use of the running estimation of the scaling as a control parameter during the gesture, or to anticipate which gesture is currently performed by early recognition.
