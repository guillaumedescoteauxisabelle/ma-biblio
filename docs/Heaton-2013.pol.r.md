Neural Network Structure
========================



Neural networks consist of layers of similar neurons. Most have at least an input layer and an output layer.

Input and Output Neurons
------------------------



### Bias Neurons



Programmers add bias neurons to neural networks to help them learn patterns.

### Context Neurons



Context neurons are used in recurrent neural networks. This type of neuron allows the neural network to maintain state.
