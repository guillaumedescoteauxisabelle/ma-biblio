reflection- in-action  has  been  often  studied, 
reflection- on-action   has   received   less   attention.

 The  tool 
uses  file  meta-data  and  naming conventions to  map  design 
materials to the appropriate design phase and context of use 
and  places  corresponding  representations  in  a  time-  and 
activity-centric   visualization   that   can   be   navigated   at 
different levels of detail. User feedback from a comparative 
study reveals that such a  representation of design process is 
more beneficial and preferred relative to the traditional file-
centric approach for fostering reflection- on-action.
