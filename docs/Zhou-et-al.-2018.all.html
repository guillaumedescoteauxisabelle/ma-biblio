<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The real world exhibits an abundance of non-stationary textures. Examples include textures with large-scale structures, as well as spatially variant and inhomogeneous textures. While existing example-based texture synthesis methods can cope well with stationary textures, non-stationary textures still pose a considerable challenge, which remains unresolved. In this paper, we propose a new approach for example-based non-stationary texture synthesis. Our approach uses a generative adversarial network (GAN), trained to double the spatial extent of texture blocks extracted from a specific texture exemplar. Once trained, the fully convolutional generator is able to expand the size of the entire exemplar, as well as of any of its sub-blocks. We demonstrate that this conceptually simple approach is highly effective for capturing large-scale structures, as well as other non-stationary attributes of the input exemplar. As a result, it can cope with challenging textures, which, to our knowledge, no other existing method can handle.</p>

<h1 id="summary">SUMMARY</h1>
<p>We have presented an example-based texture synthesis method capable of expanding an exemplar texture, while faithfully preserving the global structures therein. This is achieved by training a generative adversarial network, whose generator learns how to expand small sub windows of the exemplar to the larger texture windows containing them. A variety of results demonstrate that, through such adversarial training, the generator is able to faithfully repro-duce local patterns, as well as their global arrangements. Although a dedicated generator must be trained for each exemplar, once it is trained, synthesis is extremely fast, requiring only a single feed-forward pass through the generator network. The trained model is stable enough for repeated application, enabling generating diverse results of different sizes.</p>
