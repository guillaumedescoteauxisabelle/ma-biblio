# ct


four activities (naming, framing, moving and reflecting) and their relations: the ‘mechanism of reflective practice’. The designers start by naming the relevant issues in the design situation, framing the problem in a certain way, making moves towards a solution, and reflecting on those moves and the current frame.

**4 Activities**

*** Naming**

*** Framing**

*** Moving**

*** Reflecting**

----

explicit reflection that guides the development of one’s knowing-in- action habits.  This he calls **reflection-in-action.**

**#CT**

----

Schon’s theory is based on a **constructionist** view of human perception and thought processes: through the execution of ‘move-testing experiments’ (involving action and reflection), a designer is actively constructing a view of the world based on his/her experiences.

# limit


to improve design theory and education systematically we need to make a transition from this pure description to prescription. We need to further analyze and discuss the general patterns that occur in the described team

# metho


new description method, based on Schon’s theory of reflective practice

** #results**

----

This method was tested by applying it in the description of the activities of two design teams. The description method proves to be very useful, in that it allows a concise description of a design project in which the elements vital to the understanding of the design progress are conserved

# objecti


in-depth analysis of team design behaviour.

**ves**

----


# problematic


 [...] implicit knowledge cannot be described within the prevalent methodological paradigm of technical rationality.

****

----

implicit ‘knowing-in-action’ is difficult to describe

****

----


# result


Comparing the obtained descriptions of these two teams designing reveals different patterns of behaviour
