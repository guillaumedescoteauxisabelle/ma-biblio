<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The ideas in this book owe a great  deal  to Wladyslaw Strzemikski’s Teoria Widzenia (Theory of Vision). In discussing his  ideas  we  have  been led into many  interesting avenues and our ideas about  the processes of making and viewing  pictures have been changed. This work, which  took Strzemikski’s views as  its starting point, sets out an approach to the influence that purely  visual factors may exert in the process of picture  making and deliberately avoids issues of symbolism and iconography; the latter area in particular has been explored in a  wealth of texts by art historians o,ver the last fifty years. We are  concerned with pictures as a  record of the artist’s visual experience and how this might  be  interpreted  by the viewer. How  perceptual processes influence the creation and viewing of pictures  are our major concern. The range of the book  is then extensive but of course it  comments on only one aspect of painting. If this statement appears   self-contradictory the reader   should reflect on the enormous range of socio-cultural and psychological factors which impinge on a  work of art‘s production; perhaps  it would then become apparent why a  work  may be extensive but cover only a fraction of a possible area of study</p>

<p>Style and content can be seen to be independent of each other and viewers may be moved by either, even though in the greatest works the two aspects harmonise and complement each other.<br>[[ref2012031450]] </p>
<p>An examination of some of the intrinsic characteristics of the eye (eye used here as a shorthand for the entire visual perceptual system), leads to an enhanced appreciation of some of the limitations and subtleties of painting.</p>
