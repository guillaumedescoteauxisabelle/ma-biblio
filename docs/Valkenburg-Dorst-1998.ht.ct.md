 [...] four activities (naming, framing, moving and reflecting) and their relations:  the ‘mechanism of reflective practice’.  The designers  start by naming the relevant issues in the design situation, framing [...] making moves towards a solution, and reflecting on those moves and the current frame.  (p.254)

  

  

## 4 Activities ##

  

  

* Naming

* Framing

* Moving

* Reflecting (replacing evaluating)

  

#CT

----

explicit reflection that guides the development of one’s knowing-in- action habits.  This he calls **reflection-in-action.**

**#CT**

----

Schon’s theory is based on a constructionism

  

#CT

----

Schon’s theory is based on a **constructionist** view of human perception and thought processes: through the execution of 'move-testing experiments' (involving action and reflection), a designer is actively constructing a view of the world based on his/her experiences.

  

**#CT**

----

Donald Schon’s theory is often called ‘reflective practice’, it is concerned with more than just reflection. Four different kinds of design actions exist, and we are interested in the **occurrence of all** [...]   in the flow of how they are used by the designers.

Mon **intention** est de synthétiser ce que j'ai "picturé" auj pendant ma marche.  **Je dois faire 2 pages qui contiennent le cadre théorique.**

**Schon critique le paradigme de la rationalité-technique en expliquant ses limites au niveau des méthodologies positivistes et leurs restrictions généralisantes à propos du design.** 

** [...] design methodologists [...]   restrict themselves to  terms of generalities  about  design  processes.**   

(Valkenburg & Dorst, 1998, p. 251-252)

 [...] the **kernel** of the design ability is to **make intelligent decisions** about those **actions**.
