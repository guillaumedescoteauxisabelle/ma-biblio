IB-AR received signi cant attention in the past decades for visual communication, covering a plethora of techniques to mimic the appeal of artistic media. Example-based rendering represents one the most promising paradigms in IB-AR to (semi-)automatically simulate artistic media with high delity, but so far has been limited because it relies on pre-de ned image pairs for training or informs only low-level image features for texture transfers. Advancements in deep learning showed to alleviate these limitations by matching content and style statistics via activations of neural network layers, thus making a generalized style transfer practicable. We categorize style transfers within the taxonomy of IB-AR, then propose a semiotic structure to derive a technical research agenda for NSTs with respect to the grand challenges of NPAR. We nally discuss the potentials of NSTs, thereby identifying applications such as casual creativity and art production.","container-title":"Proceedings of the Symposium on Non-Photorealistic Animation and Rendering - NPAR '17","DOI":"10.1145/3092919.3092920","event":"the Symposium","event-place":"Los Angeles, California","ISBN":"978-1-4503-5081-5","language":"en","page":"1-13","publisher":"ACM Press","publisher-place":"Los Angeles, California","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neural style transfer: a paradigm shift for image-based artistic rendering?","title-short":"Neural style transfer","URL":"https://dl-acm-org.sbiproxy.uqac.ca/doi/abs/10.1145/3092919.3092920","author":[{"family":"Semmo","given":"Amir"},{"family":"Isenberg","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Döllner","given":"Jürgen"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,19]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]}},"citer":"Citer: (Semmo et al., 2017)\n\nFTag:Semmo-et-al-2017\n\nBiblio:\n\nSemmo, A., Isenberg, T., & Döllner, J.

On the one hand, NSTs provide new potentials for using IB-AR in context-sensitive and creative application domains, such as casual creativity apps for mobile ex- pressive rendering and production tools for feature \u001blms. On the other hand, NSTs currently provide only “black box” solutions from a HCI point-of-view: research (so far) has mainly focused on tuning hyperparameters of deep neural networks. To this end, we propose a semiotic structure to provide developers of NST techniques with the conceptual means of artworks production to help them compose and extend artistic styles, as well as consider design aspects and mechanisms for evolving NSTs as interactive tools. In particular, we hope that this structure helps researchers to identify requirements for semiotics-based loss functions, combine NSTs with the knowl- edge of other IB-AR paradigms, promote completely new artistic styles, and assist applications in illustrative visualization","id":"1M99QoKr5o","created":"2020-06-16T20:26:43.811Z","color":"yellow","guid":"1M99QoKr5o"}}}
