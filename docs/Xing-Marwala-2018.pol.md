As  innovation  emphasizes  the  implementation  of  ideas, 
creativity  is  typically  regarded  as  the  first  stage  of  innovation  in  which  generating  ideas 
becomes the dominant focus (Tang and Werner, 2017; Amabile, 1996; Mumford and Gustafson, 
1988; Rank et al., 2004; West, 2002). In other words, if creativity is absent, innovation could 
be just luck.
