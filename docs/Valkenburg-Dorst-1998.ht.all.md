 [...] four activities (naming, framing, moving and reflecting) and their relations:  the ‘mechanism of reflective practice’.  The designers  start by naming the relevant issues in the design situation, framing [...] making moves towards a solution, and reflecting on those moves and the current frame.  (p.254)

  

  

## 4 Activities ##

  

  

* Naming

* Framing

* Moving

* Reflecting (replacing evaluating)

  

#CT

----

explicit reflection that guides the development of one’s knowing-in- action habits.  This he calls **reflection-in-action.**

**#CT**

----

Schon’s theory is based on a constructionism

  

#CT

----

Schon’s theory is based on a **constructionist** view of human perception and thought processes: through the execution of 'move-testing experiments' (involving action and reflection), a designer is actively constructing a view of the world based on his/her experiences.

  

**#CT**

----

Donald Schon’s theory is often called ‘reflective practice’, it is concerned with more than just reflection. Four different kinds of design actions exist, and we are interested in the **occurrence of all** [...]   in the flow of how they are used by the designers.

Mon **intention** est de synthétiser ce que j'ai "picturé" auj pendant ma marche.  **Je dois faire 2 pages qui contiennent le cadre théorique.**

**Schon critique le paradigme de la rationalité-technique en expliquant ses limites au niveau des méthodologies positivistes et leurs restrictions généralisantes à propos du design.** 

** [...] design methodologists [...]   restrict themselves to  terms of generalities  about  design  processes.**   

(Valkenburg & Dorst, 1998, p. 251-252)

  

#intention #CT

----

 [...] the **kernel** of the design ability is to **make intelligent decisions** about those **actions**.

  

#CT #goal

# goal


 [...] look at the occurrence of the four activities and to see whether we are able to distinguish them

  

****

----


# issue


 [..] term, ‘**evaluating**’, is confusing, because it is generally used when **evaluating the content** of a design [...]  To avoid this confusion [...]   we will use the term **reflecting**.

  

 #term

----


# limit


 [...] to improve design theory and education systematically we need to make a transition from this pure description to prescription. We need to further analyze and discuss the general patterns that occur in the described teams.  
  
 #discu

----


# metho


new description method, based on Schon’s theory of reflective practice

** #results**

----

This method was tested by applying it in the description of the activities of two design teams. The description method proves to be very useful, in that it allows a concise description of a design project in which the elements vital to the understanding of the design progress are conserved

****

----


# objecti


in-depth analysis of team design behaviour.

  

  

**ves**

----

Il y a **reconnaissance du but** que se fixent les designers par l'observation des quatre types d'activité.

  

> [...] to recognise the four different activities we have to look at what the team is doing and which **goals** they have in mind.

# problematic


 [...] implicit knowledge cannot be described within the prevalent methodological paradigm of technical rationality.

****

----

implicit ‘knowing-in-action’ is difficult to describe

****

----

 [...] little of the research methods currently used in design methodology is suited for our purposes. **The complexity of design has always made it difficult to study real life design activity**, and none of the existing research methods to observe and describe designing provides us with data that is rich enough, in that it spans both the design process and relevant aspects of the design context.

  

****

----

 [...] by introducing several designers we also introduce the difficulties of team designing.

 [...]  

These lie in **synchronising the thoughts and activities** of the team members.

 [...] lead to **misunderstanding** and **uncoordinated actions.**

  

  

(p.249)

# result


Comparing the obtained descriptions of these two teams designing reveals different patterns of behaviour

**s**

----

Le contexte pour de nouvelle action est identifié comme un élément essentiel.

> [...] we noticed that the essence was the ‘**context for further activities**’. 

  



----

This addition to the structure of our description method shows the overview of the subjects the teams attend to and gives some added insight in the teams’ strategies for approaching the design task.

  



----

This way of describing team activities provides a good framework for dis- cussion on team designing. In education it can be very useful to either illustrate design professionals-in-action or to confront design teams with their own practice.
