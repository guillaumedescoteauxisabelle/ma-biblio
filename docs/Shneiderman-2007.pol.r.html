<p>creativity support tools enable discovery and innovation on a broader scale than ever before;</p>
<p> [...] modern creativity support tools also enable new forms of expression for individuals</p>
<p>Creativity includes discovery or invention of a significant idea, pattern, method, or device that gains recognition from accepted leaders in a field, while innovation requires further steps to ensure adoption (see the section “Defining and Supporting Creative Processes”).</p>
<p> [...] information visualization tools, which enable them to make discoveries about their data.</p>

<p>The chal- lenges they face stem from the vague require- ments for discovery and innovation, as well as fromtheunorthodoxuser behaviors and unclear measures of success</p>
<p>growing community of innovative tool designers and user interface visionaries is addressing a greater chal- lenge and moving from the comparatively safe territory of productivity support tools to the more risky frontier of creativity support tools</p>
<p>ccelerator for creative efforts is the capacity to locate, study, review, and revise existing projects and performances, such as open source soft- ware modules, Web page source code, architectural drawings, or music scores</p>
