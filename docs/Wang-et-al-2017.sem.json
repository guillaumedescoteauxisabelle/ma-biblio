Recently, ofﬂine training has replaced online iterative optimization, enabling nearly real-time stylization. When those stylization networks are applied directly to high-resolution images, however, the style of localized regions often appears less similar to the desired artistic style. This is because the transfer process fails to capture small, intricate textures and maintain correct texture scales of the artworks. Here we propose a multimodal convolutional neural network that takes into consideration faithful representations of both color and luminance channels, and performs stylization hierarchically with multiple losses of increasing scales. Compared to state-of-the-art networks, our network can also perform style transfer in nearly realtime by conducting much more sophisticated training ofﬂine. By properly handling style and texture cues at multiple scales using several modalities, we can transfer not just large-scale, obvious style cues but also subtle, exquisite ones. That is, our scheme can generate results that are visually pleasing and more similar to multiple desired artistic styles with color and texture cues at multiple scales.","container-title":"2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","DOI":"10.1109/CVPR.2017.759","event":"2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","event-place":"Honolulu, HI","ISBN":"978-1-5386-0457-1","language":"en","page":"7178-7186","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Honolulu, HI","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Multimodal Transfer: A Hierarchical Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Fast Artistic Style Transfer","title-short":"Multimodal Transfer","URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8100242/","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Oxholm","given":"Geoffrey"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Da"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yuan-Fang"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,23]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7]]}},"citer":"Citer:(Wang et al., 2017)\n\n  \n\nFTag:Wang-et-al-2017\n\n  \n\nAPA7:Wang, X., Oxholm, G., Zhang, D., & Wang, Y.-F.
