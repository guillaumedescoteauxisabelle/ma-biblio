{"csl":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/180474/items/F5NUM3JH","type":"paper-conference","abstract":"The emergence of computers as a core component of creative processes, coupled with recent advances in machine-learning, signal-processing, and algorithmic techniques for manipulating creative media, offers tremendous potential for building end-user creativity-support tools. However, the scientific community making advances in relevant algorithmic techniques is not, in many cases, the same community that is currently making advances in the design, evaluation, and user-experience aspects of creativity support. The primary objective of this workshop is thus to bring together participants from diverse backgrounds in the HCI, design, art, machine-learning, and algorithms communities to facilitate the advancement of novel creativity support tools.","collection-title":"CHI EA '09","container-title":"CHI '09 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems","DOI":"10.1145/1520340.1520728","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-60558-247-4","note":"ZSCC: 0000008","page":"4733–4736","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Computational creativity support: using algorithms and machine learning to help people be more creative","title-short":"Computational creativity support","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/1520340.1520728","author":[{"family":"Morris","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Secretan","given":"Jimmy"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",4,4]]}},"annotations":{"0":{"type":"text","rendermd":"Computational Creativity Support","id":"12t7Yjwt5u","created":"2020-09-18T14:38:27.797Z","color":"yellow","guid":"1d3RpGxjFU"},"1":{"type":"text","rendermd":"The emergence of computers as a core component of creative processe","id":"1b2tvT2ZKr","created":"2020-09-24T22:11:15.777Z","color":"yellow","guid":"1b2tvT2ZKr"},"2":{"type":"text","rendermd":"advances in machine-learnin","id":"1DofvejX8Z","created":"2020-09-24T22:11:23.351Z","color":"yellow","guid":"1z6cs8up1U"},"3":{"type":"text","rendermd":"Keywords\n\nOutils de support à la créativité, exploration de données (data-mining)","id":"12wPHHqMfA","created":"2020-09-24T22:12:23.517Z","color":"yellow","guid":"1jfzHJ66BX"},"4":{"type":"text","rendermd":"is intended to bring together participants from multiple communities who share an interest in creativity suppor","id":"12Gc7YvT2D","created":"2020-09-24T22:13:43.465Z","color":"#F78DA7","guid":"12Gc7YvT2D"},"5":{"type":"text","rendermd":"Identify potential collaborations among the communities represented her","id":"1eNSGbze2T","created":"2020-09-24T22:14:05.213Z","color":"yellow","guid":"1eNSGbze2T"},"6":{"type":"text","rendermd":"Facilitate discussion of the tools and methodologies","id":"1jmg5Ppuwj","created":"2020-09-24T22:14:17.925Z","color":"yellow","guid":"1jmg5Ppuwj"},"7":{"type":"text","rendermd":"Facilitate discussion of the implementation and evaluation challenge","id":"12pGCA2Yfg","created":"2020-09-24T22:14:29.298Z","color":"yellow","guid":"12pGCA2Yfg"},"8":{"type":"text","rendermd":"Conclusion\n==========","id":"1oNRYSseJV","created":"2020-09-24T22:14:39.741Z","color":"yellow","guid":"1wfSGDsCJD"},"9":{"type":"text","rendermd":"This workshop aims to bring together diverse communities to foster the advancement of creativity support tools, and we expect that it will be a unique opportunity to exchange tools and experiences from communities outside your own.
