We developed our coding scheme after reviewing existing methods of image-based research (Prosser, 1998) and interpretive tools applied to visual works (Goodenough, 1926; Harris, 1963).

The deliberate sepa- ration of individual qualities of the artwork makes it possible to recognize trends and changes over time in a quantifiable way that would not be possible if each piece were assessed in an exclusively holistic manner.

Existing approaches to analyzing art, especially youth-produced artworks, have a history of being limited to interpretation with the intent to reveal the perceptions of the artists (Bowker, 2007).

The Visual Art Coding Scheme (Appendix) was developed iteratively by two re- search assistants with substantial backgrounds in arts education, art history, and visual art-making. The language used in the coding scheme needed to describe accurately the specific, notable attributes of each image (Batey, 2012).
