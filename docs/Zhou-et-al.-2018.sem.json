{"csl":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/180474/items/DT8QF2CD","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The real world exhibits an abundance of non-stationary textures. Examples include textures with large-scale structures, as well as spatially variant and inhomogeneous textures. While existing example-based texture synthesis methods can cope well with stationary textures, non-stationary textures still pose a considerable challenge, which remains unresolved. In this paper, we propose a new approach for example-based non-stationary texture synthesis. Our approach uses a generative adversarial network (GAN), trained to double the spatial extent of texture blocks extracted from a specific texture exemplar. Once trained, the fully convolutional generator is able to expand the size of the entire exemplar, as well as of any of its sub-blocks. We demonstrate that this conceptually simple approach is highly effective for capturing large-scale structures, as well as other non-stationary attributes of the input exemplar. As a result, it can cope with challenging textures, which, to our knowledge, no other existing method can handle.","container-title":"arXiv:1805.04487 [cs]","note":"ZSCC: 0000069 \narXiv: 1805.04487","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Non-Stationary Texture Synthesis by Adversarial Expansion","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04487","author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Bai","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Lischinski","given":"Dani"},{"family":"Cohen-Or","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Hui"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,11]]}},"citer":"Citer: (Zhou et al., 2018)\n\nFTag: Zhou-et-al.-2018\n\nAPA7: Zhou, Y., Zhu, Z., Bai, X., Lischinski, D., Cohen-Or, D., & Huang, H.

This is achieved by training a generative adversarial network, whose generator learns how to expand small sub windows of the exemplar to the larger texture windows containing them. A variety of results demonstrate that, through such adversarial training, the generator is able to faithfully repro-duce local patterns, as well as their global arrangements. Although a dedicated generator must be trained for each exemplar, once it is trained, synthesis is extremely fast, requiring only a single feed-forward pass through the generator network. The trained model is stable enough for repeated application, enabling generating diverse results of different sizes.","id":"12XNtjNZde","created":"2021-01-03T13:54:39.153Z","color":"yellow","guid":"1WfBz6Uefm"}}}
