<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>There are various forms of what’s sometimes called generative art, or computer art. This paper distinguishes the major categories and asks whether the appropriate aesthetic criteria—and the locus of creativity—are the same in each case.</p>

<p>Keywords: computer art, generative art, interactive art, computational creativity</p>
<p>Rules are at the heart of this type of art. But what computer scientists call rule-based programming (e.g. Kowalski and Levy 1996) is not necessarily implied. The computer-art community regards it as important that the artwork is generated from a set of specified rules, or constraints, rather than from a step-by-step algorithm. But the detailed implementation method (i.e. the specific computer system that’s being used) is not normally seen to be significant.</p>
<p>In other words, rule-driven systems appear to have a greater degree of autonomy, relative to the conscious decisions of the human artist.</p>
<p>autonomy is a concept that’s closely connected with art-making<br>[[ArtConcept]] </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] computer artists are more comfortable in speaking of ‘generative art’ where the system is rule-driven, not algorithmic - and why they usually avoid step-by-step programming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is a **rule-driven** system?<br>[[GenerativeArt]] | [[ref2011081831]] | [[RuleDriveVSStepByStepProgramming]] | [[RuleDriven]] </p>
<p>Yet another problematic area concerns aesthetic evaluation. Are entirely novel aesthetic considerations relevant for CG-art in general, or for some subclass of it? And are some aesthetic criteria, normally regarded as essential, utterly out of place in CG-art: authenticity, for instance?<br>[[AIProblematic]] | [[ref2011081831]] </p>
<p>We’ll see that judgements concerning creativity, authorial responsibility, agency, autonomy, authenticity and (sometimes) ontology are even more problematic outside the precious bubble than inside it.<br>[[AIProblematic]] | [[ArtProblematic]] | [[ref2011081831]] </p>
<p>Generative art enables the artist to concentrate on the underlying rules themselves: the structures that define the artwork, as against the surface. (This is a position clearly associ- ated with distaste for decoration and ornament.)<br>[[GAConcept]] | [[ref2011081831]] | [[GenerativeArt]] </p>
<h1 id="a-taxonomy-of-generative-art">A taxonomy of generative art</h1>
<p>Our taxonomy distinguishes eleven types of art. We call them Ele-art, C-art, D-art, CA-art, G-art, CG-art, Evo-art, R-art, I-art, CI-art and VR-art.<br>[[GATaxonomy]] | [[ref2011081831]] </p>
<p>G-art works are generated, at least in part, by some process that is not under the artist’s direct control.</p>

<p>Most of them rely heavily on digital com- puting and in particular on methods drawn from AI / A-Life. Specifically, they have employed both symbolic and connectionist computation, and—more recently—cellular automata, L- systems and evolutionary programming too. This is an ascending spiral, not a linear ascent, because two of those ‘recent’ methods were foreseen (by John von Neumann) in 1950s cybernetics, and all three had been mathemat- ically defined by the 1960s—but none could be fruitfully explored, by artists or scientists, until powerful computers became av ai lable much later (Boden 2006, p. 15.v-vi).</p>

<p><strong>CE QUE JE LIS ET AMASSE, ANNOTE, DOIT RÉSOUDRE CE QUI EST CI-BAS:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Cet article est une étude de cas emblématique des pratiques artistiques de Memo Akten en collaboration avec intelligence artificielle.  Après avoir exposé une taxonomie de l’art génératif, cet article fera une étude de cas des œuvres de Akten en relation à la technologie des réseaux neuronaux convolutifs (RNC).  On examinera dans ce contexte ce que produisent les RNCs dans sa production artistique.</strong></p>
