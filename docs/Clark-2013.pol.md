“Perceptual learning and inference is necessary to induce prior expectations about how the sensorium unfolds. Action is engaged to resample the world to fulfil these expectations. This places perception and action in intimate rela tion and accounts for both with the same principle” (Friston, Daunizeau, and Kiebel (2009) p. 12)

the  hi erarchical  predictive  processing  perspective suggests   concerning   situated,   world - exploiting   agency   (Thelen   and   Smith   (1994), Hutchins  (1995), Wilson  (1994)  (2004),  Haugeland  (1998),  Hurley  (1998),  Clark  (1997) (2008), Clark and Chalmers (1998), Rowlands (1 999) (2006), Noë (2004), (2009), Wheeler (2005), Menary (2007)). At least on the face of it, the predictive processing story seem to pursue a rather narrowly neurocentric focus, albeit one that reveals (1.5 above) some truly intimate links between percepti on and action.
