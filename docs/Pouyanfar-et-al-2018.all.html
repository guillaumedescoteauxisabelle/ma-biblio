<p>In recent years, machine learning has become more and more popular in research and has been incorporated in a large number of applications, including multimedia concept retrieval, image clas- sification, video recommendation, social network analysis, text mining, and so forth.</p>
<p>Deep learning, which has its roots from conventional neural networks, significantly outperforms its predecessors. It utilizes graph technologies with transformations among neurons to develop many-layered learning models.</p>
