<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Artificial life, or a-life, is an interdisciplinary science focused on artificial systems that mimic the properties of living systems. In the 1990s, new media artists began appropriating and adapting the techniques of a-life science to create a-life art; Mitchell Whitelaw&#39;s Metacreationis the first detailed critical account of this new field of creative practice.</p>
<p>A-life art responds to the increasing technologization of living matter by creating works that seem to mutate, evolve, and respond with a life of their own. Pursuing a-life&#39;s promise of emergence, these artists produce not only artworks, but generative and creative processes: here creation becomes metacreation.</p>
<p>Whitelaw presents a-life art practice through four of its characteristic techniques and tendencies. &quot;Breeders&quot; use artificial evolution to generate images and forms, in the process altering the artist&#39;s creative agency. &quot;Cybernatures&quot; form complex, interactive systems, drawing the audience into artificial ecosystems. Other artists work in &quot;Hardware,&quot; adapting Rodney Brooks&#39;s &quot;bottom-up&quot; robotics to create embodied autonomous agencies. The &quot;Abstract Machines&quot; of a-life art de-emphasize the biological analogy, using techniques such as cellular automata to investigate pattern, form and morphogenesis.</p>
<p>In the book&#39;s concluding chapters, Whitelaw surveys the theoretical discourses around a-life art, before finally examining emergence, a concept central to a-life, and key, it is argued, to a-life art.</p>
