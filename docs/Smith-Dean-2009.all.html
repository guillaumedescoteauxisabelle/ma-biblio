<p> [...] there are many rich and innovative ways in which creative practice can constitute, or contribute to, research in the university environment.</p>

<p>ponder how academic research can impact positively on creative practice</p>
<p>Creative work within the university environment is now often referred to as practice-led research, practice-based research, creative research or practice as research.</p>

However, in the last two to three decades, the idea that arts practice might be a form of research has been developing ascendency. Terms such as practice-led research have been developed by creative practitioners, partly for political purposes within higher education, research and other environments, to explain, justify and promote their activities, and to argue – as forcefully as possible in an often unreceptive environment – that they are as important to the generation of knowledge as more theoretically, critically or empirically based research methods.
