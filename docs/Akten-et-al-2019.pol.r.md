Learning to See
===============



real-world representations



We use a novel training system and custom software



reconstructs a new image that resembles the input in composition and overall shape and structure



demonstrating how critical the training data is to the predictions that the model will make



Metaphorically speaking, the training data determines the full life experience of the network and ultimately shapes its worldview

build hierarchies of representations and extract meaningful information from vast amounts of high-dimensional raw dat



are not focusing on the potential of DL systems as a real-time human-machine collaborative tool or instrumen



We design our system to enable users to create what can be thought of as animated content, in a real-time, interactive manner



digital puppetry



The second form of real-time interactivity comes through a number of parameters (which can be controlled via a MIDI controller, or a graphical user interface [GUI] ) that influence how the output image is reconstructed



Network Architecture and Training



We might even go as far as to claim that the model contains knowledge of the structure of elements related to the contents of the dataset.



 [...] offer a range of potential creative affordances

The exploration of these representations acts as a metaphor for the process of developing a visual understanding and/or visual vocabulary of the world.
