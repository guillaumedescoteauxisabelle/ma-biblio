While reflection-in-action has been often studied, reflection-on-action has received less attention. In this paper, we fill this gap by first reporting results from indepth interviews (N=12) with practicing designers aimed at understanding activities related to reflection-on-action. We found that activities related to reflection-on-action are intentional, repetitive and frequent, design materials are the primary aids for reflective activities, and there is a strong need for better reflection support tools. To address this need, we designed, implemented and evaluated a novel interactive visualization tool – ReflectionSpace. The tool uses file meta-data and naming conventions to map design materials to the appropriate design phase and context of use and places corresponding representations in a time- and activity-centric visualization that can be navigated at different levels of detail. User feedback from a comparative study reveals that such a representation of design process is more beneficial and preferred relative to the traditional filecentric approach for fostering reflection-on-action.","container-title":"Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Creativity & Cognition - C&C '13","DOI":"10.1145/2466627.2466645","event":"the 9th ACM Conference","event-place":"Sydney, Australia","ISBN":"978-1-4503-2150-1","language":"en","note":"ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]","page":"83","publisher":"ACM Press","publisher-place":"Sydney, Australia","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"ReflectionSpace: an interactive visualization tool for supporting reflection- <i>on</i> -action in design","title-short":"ReflectionSpace","URL":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2466627.2466645","author":[{"family":"Sharmin","given":"Moushumi"},{"family":"Bailey","given":"Brian P."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,8]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]}},"citer":"Citer: (Sharmin & Bailey, 2013)\n\nFTag: Sharmin-Bailey-2013\n\nAPA7: Sharmin, M., & Bailey, B.
