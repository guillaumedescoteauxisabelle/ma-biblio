<tr>
<td>6.</td>
<td>CG-art</td>
<td>CG-art  is produced by leaving a computer program to run by itself, with minimal or zero interference from a human being. NB: We chose to reject the stricter definition of CG-art (art produced by a program left to run by itself, with zero interference from the human artist).</td>

<td>7.</td>
<td>Evo-art</td>
<td>Evo-art  is evolved by processes of random variation and selective reproduction that affect the art-generating program itself.</td>

<td>I-art</td>
