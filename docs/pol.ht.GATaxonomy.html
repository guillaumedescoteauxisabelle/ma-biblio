<p>Our taxonomy distinguishes eleven types of art. We call them Ele-art, C-art, D-art, CA-art, G-art, CG-art, Evo-art, R-art, I-art, CI-art and VR-art.</p>

<p>|   1.    |  Ele-art       |  involves electrical engineering and / or electronic technology.     |       |<br>|   2.    |  C-art      |  C-art uses computers as part of the art- making process.     |       |<br>|   3.    |  D-art     | D-art  uses digital electronic technology of some sort.     |       |<br>|   4.    |  CA-art     |  CA-art uses the computer as an aid (in principle, non-essential) in the art-making process.      |       |<br>|  5.     |  G-art     |  works are generated, at least in part, by some process that is not under the artistâ€™s direct control.      |       |<br>|  6.     |  CG-art    |   CG-art  is produced by leaving a computer program to run by itself, with minimal or zero interference from a human being. NB: We chose to reject the stricter definition of CG-art (art produced by a program left to run by itself, with zero interference from the human artist).     |       |<br>|   7.    |  Evo-art    |  Evo-art  is evolved by processes of random variation and selective reproduction that affect the art-generating program itself.      |       |<br>|   8.    |  R-art    | R-art  is the construction of robots for artistic purposes, where robots are physical machines capable of autonomous move- ment and / or communication.      |       |<br>|  9.     |  I-art    |  In I-art, the form / content of the artwork is significantly affected by the behaviour of the audience.      |       |<br>|   10.    |  CI-art     |  In CI-art, the form / content of some CG-artwork is significantly affected by the behaviour of the audience.     |<br>|   11.    |   VR-art    |  In VR-art, the observer is immersed in a computer-generated virtual world, experiencing it and responding to it as if it were real.     |       |</p>
