 four activities (naming, framing, moving and reflecting) and
their relations:  the ‘mechanism of reflective practice’. The designers  start
by naming the relevant issues in the design situation, framing the problem
in a certain way, making moves towards a solution, and reflecting on those
moves and the current frame.

This method was tested by applying it in the description of the activities
of two design teams. The description method proves to be very useful, in
that it allows a concise description of a design project in which the
elements vital to the understanding of the design progress are
conserved

little  of the  research  methods
currently used in design methodology is suited for our purposes. The com-
plexity  of  design  has  always  made  it  difficult  to  study  real  life  design
activity, and none of the existing research methods to observe and describe
designing  provides  us with  data  that  is rich  enough, in  that  it spans  both
the design process and relevant aspects of the design context.

n’s theory is based on a constructionist view of human perception and
thought  processes:  through  the  execution  of  ‘move-testing  experiments’
(involving action and reflection), a designer is actively constructing a view
of the world based on his/her experiences.
