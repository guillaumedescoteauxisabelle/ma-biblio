{"csl":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/180474/items/W5KKZ2ZP","type":"paper-conference","abstract":"The creative process requires experimentation, the exploration of variations, and the continual evaluation of one’s progress. While these processes are frequently non-linear and iterative, modern user interfaces do not explicitly support these practices, and instead impose a linear progression through tasks that is a poor fit for creative pursuits. In this paper we use data from three case studies, and draw upon Schön’s theory of reflection-in-action to illustrate specific deficiencies in current user interfaces when used in creative endeavors. We then develop a set of guidelines for user interface design and demonstrate their application in three designs intended to support tasks in the domain of image manipulation.","container-title":"Proceedings of the fourth conference on Creativity & cognition  - C&C '02","DOI":"10.1145/581710.581718","event":"the fourth conference","event-place":"Loughborough, UK","ISBN":"978-1-58113-465-0","language":"en","note":"ZSCC: 0000136","page":"38-44","publisher":"ACM Press","publisher-place":"Loughborough, UK","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Recognizing creative needs in user interface design","URL":"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=581710.581718","author":[{"family":"Terry","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Mynatt","given":"Elizabeth D."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,8]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]}},"annotations":{"0":{"type":"text","rendermd":"Recognizing Creative Needs in User Interface Design\n===================================================","id":"1VHG6YPZad","created":"2020-10-13T20:08:04.665Z","color":"yellow","guid":"12rHv27w6Z"},"1":{"type":"text","rendermd":"The creative process requires experimentation, the exploration of variations, and the continual evaluation of one’s progress.   [...] these processes are frequently non-linear and iterative [...] \n\n  \n\n#context","hData":{"t":"The creative process requires experimentation, the exploration of variations, and the continual evaluation of one’s progress.   [...] these processes are frequently non-linear and iterative [...] \n\n  \n\n","y":"context"},"id":"12CtTaneay","created":"2020-10-13T20:08:25.034Z","color":"#9900EF","guid":"12XXQx2PRk"},"2":{"type":"text","rendermd":" [...] these processes are frequently non-linear and iterative,\n\n#context","hData":{"t":" [...] these processes are frequently non-linear and iterative,\n\n","y":"context"},"id":"1cquMNjkbh","created":"2020-10-13T20:08:47.155Z","color":"green","guid":"1GnpdVhGdQ"},"3":{"type":"text","rendermd":" [...] modern user interfaces do not explicitly support these practices, and instead impose a linear progression through tasks that is a poor fit for creative pursuits.\n\n  \n\n#problematic","hData":{"t":" [...] modern user interfaces do not explicitly support these practices, and instead impose a linear progression through tasks that is a poor fit for creative pursuits.\n\n  \n\n","y":"problematic"},"id":"12YS7n6H6f","created":"2020-10-13T20:08:59.897Z","color":"#FF6900","guid":"1QJuh4otv8"},"4":{"type":"text","rendermd":" [...] we use data from three case studies, and draw upon Schön’s theory of reflection-in-action to illustrate specific deficiencies in current user interfaces when used in creative endeavors\n\n  \n\n#ct","hData":{"t":" [...] we use data from three case studies, and draw upon Schön’s theory of reflection-in-action to illustrate specific deficiencies in current user interfaces when used in creative endeavors\n\n  \n\n","y":"ct"},"id":"1ESS3DSu8C","created":"2020-10-13T20:09:29.483Z","color":"red","guid":"1KhEkJhyTW"},"5":{"type":"text","rendermd":"Terry\n\n  \n\nCiter:(Terry & Mynatt, 2002)\n\nFTag: Terry-Mynatt-2002\n\nAPA7: Terry, M., & Mynatt, E.
