Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)



Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs, are a popular and very successful method for learning and generating sequences



 [...] current generative RNN techniques do not allow real-time interactive control of the sequence generation process, thus aren’t well suited for live creative expression .

We propose a method of real-time continuous control and ‘steering’ of sequence generation using an ensemble of RNNs and dynamically altering the mixture weights of the models. W



e demonstrate the method using character based LSTM networks and a gestural interface allowing users to ‘conduct’ the generation of text.



Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are artificial neural networks with recurrent connections, allowing them to learn temporal regularities and model sequences.



Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) [ 16] is a recurrent architecture that overcomes the problem of gradients exponentially vanishing [ 15, 1] , and allows RNNs to be trained many time-steps into the past, to learn more complex programs [ 21].

#biblio



 [...] with increased compute power and large training sets, LSTMs and related architectures are proving successful not only in sequence classification [11, 14, 20, 12] , but also in sequence generation in many domains such as music [6, 2, 19, 22] , text [24, 23] , handwriting [10] , images [13] , machine translation \ [25\] , speech synthesis \ [28\] and even choreography \ [4\] 

  

#review



 [...] most current applications of sequence generation with RNNs is not a real-time, interactive process.

  

#problematic



ll does not provide real-time continuous control in the manner required for the creation of expressive interface
