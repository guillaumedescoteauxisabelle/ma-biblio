{"csl":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/180474/items/3LAVEEGU","type":"paper-conference","abstract":"Creativity support tools are important to professionals and amateurs alike. Typically, these tools abstract away the mundane details of creative design to allow the user to focus on her creative process. However, emerging techniques in data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence all have the potential to enhance the efficiency, productivity, accessibility and usability of these tools. Leveraging these techniques, creativity support tools are poised to move from the role of an assistant carrying out chores for the user to a role as a creative collaborator.","collection-title":"C&amp;C '11","container-title":"Proceedings of the 8th ACM conference on Creativity and cognition","DOI":"10.1145/2069618.2069743","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-0820-5","note":"ZSCC: 0000000","page":"447–448","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Semi-automated creativity: software as a creative collaborator","title-short":"Semi-automated creativity","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/2069618.2069743","author":[{"family":"Secretan","given":"Jimmy"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",11,3]]}},"annotations":{"0":{"type":"text","rendermd":"Semi-Automated Creativity:","id":"1xR5qKugqU","created":"2020-09-18T14:38:36.088Z","color":"yellow","guid":"1xR5qKugqU"},"1":{"type":"text","rendermd":"tools abstract away the mundane details of creative design to allow the user to focus on her creative process.","id":"1APk5q5mqZ","created":"2020-09-18T20:22:32.311Z","color":"yellow","guid":"1221ZwiBvh"},"2":{"type":"text","rendermd":"Shneiderman, B., “Creativity Support Tools: Accelerating Discovery and Innovation,” Communications of the ACM , Vol. 50, No. 12, December 2007.","id":"1qJ9VxeDw6","created":"2020-09-20T23:35:49.021Z","color":"#EB144C","guid":"1qJ9VxeDw6"},"3":{"type":"text","rendermd":"Finke, R.; Ward, T.
