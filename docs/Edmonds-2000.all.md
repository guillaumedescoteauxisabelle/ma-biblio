## Abstract

Computers can be very helpful to us by performing tasks on our behalf. For example, they are very good at performing calculations, storing information and producing visualisations of objects that do not yet exist as a made artifact. Increasingly, however, a different role is being found for the computer. It is the role of a catalyst, or a stimulant, to our own creative thinking. In such cases the computer is not primarily performing a task for us and generating an answer within itself, rather it is helping us to generate answers within ourselves. The computer helps us think creatively. This role for the computer can be illustrated in the context of computer support to creative design. In order to design computer systems that support the creative process, it is important to understand that process well enough to predict what might help, rather than hinder. Given such research, we may begin to define the characteristics of what the computer must do in order to augment creative thinking. The paper explores a particular application of intelligent user interfaces —the augmentation of creative thought in artists.

Previewing concrete implication of decision 
--------------------------------------------

>By using intelligent agents to generate the concrete realisations of the structure decisions the artist can see the implications within very short intervals of time



Les opportunités d'augmentation ne se produisent pas à la surface mais avec des considérations fondamentales sur la structure qui permettent une compréhension des implications concrètes de ce qui structure une décision.  Dans cette structure sous-jascente à la surface se trouvent les possibilités d'augmentation.

>The problem is to understand the concrete implications (through to the surface) of the structural decisions. This is where a significant opportunity for augmentation arises.

Le rôle de l'agent dans l'interface utilisateur intelligente est de permettre à l'artiste de percevoir les implications structurales du contexte artistique actuel et ainsi, dans un interval de temps cours, pouvoir penser, évaluer et décider d'agir.

  

>The significant role of the agents in the user interface is to enable the artist to think and act in terms of the structures whilst, as a result of the agent's work, easily and quickly see the implications.

Les interfaces d'utilisation intelligente (IDUI) augmenterait la capacité de l'artiste suffisamment pour promouvoir une orientation créative plutôt que d'être à un niveau où il y a des inquiétudes.

Thought is not a means of solving the problem
---------------------------------------------  
[[ProblemSolving]] | [[CreativeOrientation]] | [[ref2011081831]] 





Thought is not a problem solver but a great process of realisation that is forever transcending, transformed, changed, developed. (Mead 1917)  
[[ProblemSolving]] | [[ref2011081831]] | [[CreativeOrientation]] 





By computer creativity is meant the possibility of computers doing things that humans might consider to be creative and by creative computation is meant humans being able to do creative things with the help of computers.

Supporting creative users

A creation is made of its underlying structure.

intelligent user interfaces may well have a significant role to play in easing the transition from those structures to the form of the artifact.

It is concern ed instead with computer support that stimulates our thinking rather than that saves us work



The concern is with how to provide support that stimulates us to think in new ways and so helps, in part, our creative lives
