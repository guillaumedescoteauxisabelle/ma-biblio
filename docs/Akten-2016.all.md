## Abstract

This is the first of a series of articles [1, 2, 3], on research I’ve done over the past few years that I’m only just getting round to…

Collaborative creativity with Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Convolutional Neural Networks
=======================================================================================



an autonomous agent sketches images while optionally allowing a user to directly influence the agent’s trajectory.



computational models of creativity

  

#context  
[[AIContext]] 





 [...] we focus on investigating the opportunities provided by Deep artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) — in particular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) — combined with agent-based AI methods — such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) — for the task of driving collaborative drawing agents

  

#goal  
[[AIInvestigation]] 





We combine Monte Carlo Tree Search with image classifiers and test both shallow models (e.g. multinomial logistic regression) and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (e.g. LeNet, Inception v3).



The aim of this research is to create an autonomous, collaborative, ‘creative’ agent that can sketch images in realtime, while optionally allowing a user to intervene and physically influence the agent, affecting how and what it decides to draw.  [...] our objective is to allow the agent to take random actions, and sketch any path that resembles a predetermined, desired object class .
