We propose an additional classifier that estimates  the  minimal  amount  of  regularization  required to enforce disentanglement.  Thus both representations to- gether can completely explain an image while being inde- pendent of each other.  Previous methods based on adver- sarial approaches fail to enforce this independence, while methods based on variational approaches lead to uninfor- mative  representations.
