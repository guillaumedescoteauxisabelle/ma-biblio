<p>real-world representations</p>
<p>We use a novel training system and custom software</p>
<p>reconstructs a new image that resembles the input in composition and overall shape and structure</p>
<p>demonstrating how critical the training data is to the predictions that the model will make</p>
<p>Metaphorically speaking, the training data determines the full life experience of the network and ultimately shapes its worldview</p>

<p>build hierarchies of representations and extract meaningful information from vast amounts of high-dimensional raw dat</p>
<p>are not focusing on the potential of DL systems as a real-time human-machine collaborative tool or instrumen</p>
<p>We design our system to enable users to create what can be thought of as animated content, in a real-time, interactive manner</p>
<p>digital puppetry</p>
<p>The second form of real-time interactivity comes through a number of parameters (which can be controlled via a MIDI controller, or a graphical user interface [GUI] ) that influence how the output image is reconstructed</p>
<p>Network Architecture and Training</p>
<p>We might even go as far as to claim that the model contains knowledge of the structure of elements related to the contents of the dataset.</p>
<p> [...] offer a range of potential creative affordances</p>

<p>The exploration of these representations acts as a metaphor for the process of developing a visual understanding and/or visual vocabulary of the world.</p>
