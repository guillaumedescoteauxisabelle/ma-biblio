<p>METAPHOR AND REPRESENTATION</p>
<p>Generative metaphor: A perspective on problem-setting in social policy DONALD A . SCHON</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Metaphor, in this tradition, is a kind of anomaly of language, one which must be dispelled in order to clear the path for a general theory of reference or meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] &quot;metaphor&quot; refers both to a certain kind of product - a perspective or frame, a way of looking at things - and to a certain kind of process - a process by which new perspectives on the world come into existence. (p.137)</p>
