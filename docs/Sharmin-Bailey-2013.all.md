> [...] reflection-in-action has been often studied, reflection-on-action has received less attention.  
  

#problematic



there is a strong need for better reflection support tools.



The tool uses file meta-data and naming conventions to map design materials to the appropriate design phase and context of use and places corresponding representations in a time- and activity-centric visualization that can be navigated at different levels of detail. User feedback from a comparative study reveals that such a representation of design process is more beneficial and preferred relative to the traditional file- centric approach for fostering reflection- on-action.



Keywords: Reflection; reflection-on-action; creative design; design materials; design process; reflection support tools.

  

ACM Classification Keywords : Information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI)



 [...] our work contributes the design and implementation of a novel interactive tool called ReflectionSpace.
