investigating the opportunities
provided by Deep artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) — in particular
Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN)
— combined with agent-based AI methods — such as
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
—
for the task of driving collaborative drawing agents

We combine Monte Carlo Tree Search with image
classifiers and test both shallow models (e.g. multinomial logistic regression) and
deep Convolutional Neural Networks (e.g. LeNet, Inception v3).

The aim of this research is to create an autonomous, collaborative, ‘creative’ agent that can sketch
images in realtime, while optionally allowing a user to intervene and physically influence the agent,
affecting how and what it decides to draw

ic, our objective is to allow the agent to take random actions, and sketch any path (i.e. follow any trajectory) that resembles a predetermined, desired object class .
