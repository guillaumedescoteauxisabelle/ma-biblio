In recent years, machine learning has become more and more popular in research and has been incorporated in a large number of applications, including multimedia concept retrieval, image clas- sification, video recommendation, social network analysis, text mining, and so forth.



Deep learning, which has its roots from conventional neural networks, significantly outperforms its predecessors. It utilizes graph technologies with transformations among neurons to develop many-layered learning models.
