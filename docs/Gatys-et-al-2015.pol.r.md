In fine art, especially painting, humans have mastered the skill to create unique visual experiences through composing a complex interplay between the content and style of an image



The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic image



 [...] an algorithmic understanding of how humans create and perceive artistic imagery.  (Gatys et al., 2015)



The class of Deep Neural Networks that are most powerful in image processing tasks are called Convolutional Neural Network



Convolutional Neural Networks consist of layers of small computational units that process visual information hierarchically [...]   (Gatys et al., 2015)
