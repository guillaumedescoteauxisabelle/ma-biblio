<p>four activities (naming, framing, moving and reflecting) and their relations: the ‘mechanism of reflective practice’. The designers start by naming the relevant issues in the design situation, framing the problem in a certain way, making moves towards a solution, and reflecting on those moves and the current frame.</p>

<p>explicit reflection that guides the development of one’s knowing-in- action habits.  This he calls <strong>reflection-in-action.</strong></p>

<p>Schon’s theory is based on a <strong>constructionist</strong> view of human perception and thought processes: through the execution of ‘move-testing experiments’ (involving action and reflection), a designer is actively constructing a view of the world based on his/her experiences.</p>

<p>to improve design theory and education systematically we need to make a transition from this pure description to prescription. We need to further analyze and discuss the general patterns that occur in the described team  </p>

<p>This method was tested by applying it in the description of the activities of two design teams. The description method proves to be very useful, in that it allows a concise description of a design project in which the elements vital to the understanding of the design progress are conserved</p>
