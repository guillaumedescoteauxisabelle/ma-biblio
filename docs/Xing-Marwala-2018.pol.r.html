<p> [...] application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the creation of digital art.</p>
<p>#context<br>  [[AIContext]] | </p>
<p>Machine learning is the statistical approach to building intelligent systems.</p>
<p>machine learning</p>
<p>evolutionary programming</p>
<p>soft computing.</p>
<p>Evolutionary programming is the use of natural evolutionary systems to design intelligent machines</p>
<p>Soft computing includes techniques such as agent based modelling and fuzzy logic.</p>
<p> [...] definition of creativity remains rather controversial [...]   (Tang and Werner, 2017; Hernandez-Romero, 2017).</p>
<p>Though creativity can be generally understood as the capability of producing original and novel work or knowledge, the universaldefinition of creativity remainsrather controversial, mainlydue to its complex nature (Tang and Werner, 2017; Hernandez-Romero, 2017).</p>
<p> [...] classified into <strong>three categories</strong>, namely, narrow AI, AGI (<strong>artificial general intelligence</strong>), and <strong>conscious AI</strong> (Wang and Goertzel, 2012).</p>
<p>Why Digital Art ?</p>
<p>Creativity and Artificial Intelligence</p>
<p>Short-Term Cases: AI-A ssisted Digital Art Creation</p>
<p>Mid-Term Cases: Human and AI Collaborated Digital Art Creation</p>
<p>Long-Term Cases: Art Decentralized Autonomous Organization (ArtDAO)</p>
<p>Technological development or revolution has a long history of influencing creativity.</p>
<p>With new communication capacity being enabled by this technological advancement, the widespread of material and intellectual exchange becomes possible.</p>
<p>e user friendly interface will become a crucial element for facilitating the interaction between human and robot</p>
<p>The current usefulness of AI does not necessarily dwarf our human’s creativity; on the contrary, the research and development of AI is largely spurred by our own internal creativity.</p>

<p>Opportunities on the applications of these to digital art are explored.</p>
<p>#goal</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As innovation emphasizes the implementation of ideas, creativity is typically regarded as the first stage of innovation in which generating ideas becomes the dominant focus (Tang and Werner, 2017; Amabile, 1996; Mumford and Gustafson, 1988; Rank et al., 2004; West, 2002). In other words, if creativity is absent, innovation could be just luck. [...]  definition of creativity remains rather controversial,  mainly due to its complex nature (Tang and Werner, 2017; Hernández-Romero, 2017).</p>
