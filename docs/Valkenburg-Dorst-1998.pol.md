their relations:  the ‘mechanism of reflective practice’. The designers  start
by naming the relevant issues in the design situation, framing the problem
in a certain way, making moves towards a solution, and reflecting on those
moves and the current frame.

little  of the  research  methods
currently used in design methodology is suited for our purposes. The com-
plexity  of  design  has  always  made  it  difficult  to  study  real  life  design
activity, and none of the existing research methods to observe and describe
designing  provides  us with  data  that  is rich  enough, in  that  it spans  both
the design process and relevant aspects of the design context.

theory is often called ‘reflective practice’, it is concerned with more than
just  reflection.  Four  different  kinds  of  design  actions  exist,  and  we  are
interested  in  the  occurrence  of  all  four  of  them,  and  in  the  flow  of  how
they are used by the designers.

problem (when the frame is not satisfactory), the making of new moves, or
attending to new issues (naming, when the reflection leads to satisfaction)

The frame is a context
for  the  next  activities;  something  to  hold  on  to  and  to  focus  on  while
designing. Therefore a frame is mostly only recognisable through the fol-
lowing activity.

be visualised as a box in which other activities can occur (see Figure 2).

Experimental  actions  like  generating  ideas,  making  an  inventory,  sorting
information,   combining   ideas,   or   comparing   concepts   are   coded   as
‘moving’.  During  the  ‘moving’-activity,  the  team  not  only  tries  to  solve
the problem, but at the same time also explores the suitability of the frame.
The move is always characterised by a verb, identifying the activity, comp-
lemented with the content of the activity
