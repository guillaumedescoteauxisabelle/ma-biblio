. Rules are at the heart of this type of art. But what computer scientists call rule-based programming (e.g. Kowalski and Levy 1996) is not necessarily implied. The computer-art community regards it as important that the artwork is generated from a set of specified rules, or constraints, rather than from a step-by-step algorithm. But the detailed implementation method (i.e. the specific computer system that’s being used) is not normally seen to be significant.

In other words, rule-driven systems appear to have a greater degree of autonomy, relative to the conscious decisions of the human artist.

omputer artists are more comfortable in speaking of ‘generative art’ where the system is rule-driven, not algorith- mic—and why they usually avoid step-by-step programming.

Yet another problematic area concerns aesthetic evaluation. Are entirely novel aesthetic considerations relevant for CG-art in general, or for some subclass of it? And are some aesthetic criteria, normally regarded as essential, utterly out of place in CG-art: authenticity, for instance?

We’ll see that judgements concerning creativity, authorial responsibility, agency, autonomy, authenticity and (sometimes) ontology are even more problematic outside the precious bubble than inside it.

Generative art enables the artist to concentrate on the underlying rules themselves: the structures that define the artwork, as against the surface. (This is a position clearly associ- ated with distaste for decoration and ornament.)

Our taxonomy distinguishes eleven types of art. We call them Ele-art, C-art, D-art, CA-art, G-art, CG-art, Evo-art, R-art, I-art, CI-art and VR-art.

Most of them rely heavily on digital com- puting and in particular on methods drawn from AI / A-Life. Specifically, they have employed both symbolic and connectionist computation, and—more recently—cellular automata, L- systems and evolutionary programming too. This is an ascending spiral, not a linear ascent, because two of those ‘recent’ methods were foreseen (by John von Neumann) in 1950s cybernetics, and all three had been mathemat- ically defined by the 1960s—but none could be fruitfully explored, by artists or scientists, until powerful computers became av ai lable much later (Boden 2006, p. 15.v-vi).

1.  Ele-art involves electrical engineering and / or electronic technology. 2.  C-art uses computers as part of the art- making process. 3.  D-art uses digital electronic technology of some sort. 4.  CA-art uses the computer as an ai d (in principle, non-essential) in the art-making process. 5.  G-art works are generated, at least in part, by some process that is not under the artist’s direct control. 6.  CG-art is produced by leaving a computer program to run by itself, with minimal or zero interference from a human being. NB: We chose to reject the stricter definition of CG-art (art produced by a program left to run by itself, with zero interference from the human artist). 7.  Evo-art is evolved by processes of random variation and selective reproduction that affect the art-generating program itself. 8.  R-art is the construction of robots for artistic purposes, where robots are physical machines capable of autonomous move- ment and / or communication. 9.  In I-art, the form / content of the artwork is significantly affected by the behaviour of the audience. 10.  In CI-art, the form / content of some CG-artwork is significantly affected by the behaviour of the audience.
