<p>Why Digital Art ?</p>
<p>Creativity and Artificial Intelligence</p>
<p>Short-Term Cases: AI-A ssisted Digital Art Creation</p>
<p>Mid-Term Cases: Human and AI Collaborated Digital Art Creation</p>
<p>Long-Term Cases: Art Decentralized Autonomous Organization (ArtDAO)</p>
<p>Technological development or revolution has a long history of influencing creativity.</p>
<p>With new communication capacity being enabled by this technological advancement, the widespread of material and intellectual exchange becomes possible.</p>
